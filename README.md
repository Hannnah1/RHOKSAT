# Intro and Environment Settup
Once the cubesat is in space we will communicate with it using a LimeSDR and gnuradio.
We chose to use a linux enviroonment to ensure maximum software compatability.

Once you have an ubuntu system up and running, gnuradio can be installed following [these instructions](https://wiki.gnuradio.org/index.php/InstallingGR)
run the commands under the section titled "ubuntu PPA installation"

# Testing the setup
To test our setup we first created an fm transmitter and receiver. The grc files are [here](fm)
