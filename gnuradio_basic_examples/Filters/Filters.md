## Intro 
The .grc file has an example which takes an input file and allows you to switch the filter being used.

## Block descriptions
* **Band Pass Filter** - Filters out the extremely low and high frequencies. Only allows the miid-range frequencies to pass through. If it were a real circut this means the high level frequencies would be mostly filtered out by the capacitor,and the low frequencies by the inductor. Thus the middlevel frequencies would have the highest voltage going out of the circut. No idea how this works in software.
